 # or now you can write like below if you want to use 4.0:
 #my $vc = Text::vCard::Precisely->new( version => '4.0' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A vCard is a digital business card.
vCard and L<Text::vFile::asData|https://github.com/richardc/perl-text-vfile-asdata> provides an API for parsing vCards

This module is forked from L<Text::vCard|https://github.com/ranguard/text-vcard>
because some reason below:

=over

=item

Text::vCard B<doesn't provide> full methods based on L<RFC2426|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2426>

=item

Mac OS X and iOS can't parse vCard4.0 with UTF-8 precisely. they cause some Mojibake

=item

Android 4.4.x can't parse vCard4.0

=back

To handle an address book with several vCard entries in it, start with
L<Text::vFile::asData|https://github.com/richardc/perl-text-vfile-asdata> and then come back to this module.

Note that the vCard RFC requires version() and full_name().  This module does not check or warn yet if these conditions have not been met

=head1 Constructors

=head2 load_hashref($HashRef)

Accepts an HashRef that looks like below:

 my $hashref = {
    N   => [ 'Gump', 'Forrest', '', 'Mr.', '' ],
    FN  => 'Forrest Gump',
    SORT_STRING => 'Forrest Gump',
    ORG => 'Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.',
    TITLE => 'Shrimp Man',
    PHOTO => { media_type => 'image/gif', content => 'http://www.example.com/dir_photos/my_photo.gif' },
    TEL => [
        { types => ['WORK','VOICE'], content => '(111) 555-1212' },
        { types => ['HOME','VOICE'], content => '(404) 555-1212' },
    ],
    ADR =>[{
        types       => ['work'],
        pref        => 1,
        extended    => 100,
        street      => 'Waters Edge',
        city        => 'Baytown',

    EMAIL => 'forrestgump@example.com',
    REV => '2008-04-24T19:52:43Z',
 };

=head2 load_file($file_name)

Accepts a file name

=head2 load_string($vCard)

Accepts a vCard string

=head1 METHODS

=head2 as_string()

Returns the vCard as a string.
You have to use Encode::encode_utf8() if your vCard is written in utf8

=head2 as_file($filename)

Write data in vCard format to $filename.
Dies if not successful

=head1 SIMPLE GETTERS/SETTERS

These methods accept and return strings

=head2 version()

returns Version number of the vcard.
Defaults to B<'3.0'> and this method is B<READONLY>

=head2 rev()

To specify revision information about the current vCard

=head2 sort_string()

To specify the family name, given name or organization text to be used for
national-language-specific sorting of the FN, N and ORG.

B<This method is DEPRECATED in vCard4.0> Use SORT-AS param instead of it.

=head1 COMPLEX GETTERS/SETTERS

They are based on Moose with coercion.
So these methods accept not only ArrayRef[HashRef] but also ArrayRef[Str], single HashRef
or single Str.
Read source if you were confused

=head2 n()

To specify the components of the name of the object the vCard represents

=head2 tel()

Accepts/returns an ArrayRef that looks like:

 [
    { type => ['work'], content => '651-290-1234', preferred => 1 },
    { type => ['home'], content => '651-290-1111' },
 ]

After version 0.18, B<content will not be validated as phone numbers> All I<Str> type is accepted.
So you have to validate phone numbers with your way.

=head2 adr(), address()

Accepts/returns an ArrayRef that looks like:

 [
    { types => ['work'], street => 'Main St', pref => 1 },
    {   types     => ['home'],
        pobox     => 1234,
        extended  => 'asdf',
        street    => 'Army St',
        city      => 'Desert Base',
        region    => '',
        post_code => '',
        country   => 'USA',
        pref      => 2,
    },
 ]

=head2 email()

Accepts/returns an ArrayRef that looks like:

 [
    { type => ['work'], content => 'bbanner@ssh.secret.army.mil' },
    { type => ['home'], content => 'bbanner@timewarner.com', pref => 1 },
 ]

or accept the string as email like below

 'bbanner@timewarner.com'

=head2 url()

Accepts/returns an ArrayRef that looks like:

 [
    { content => 'https://twitter.com/worthmine', types => ['twitter'] },
    { content => 'https://github.com/worthmine' },
 ]

or accept the string as URL like below

 'https://github.com/worthmine'

=head2 photo(), logo()

Accepts/returns an ArrayRef of URLs or Images: Even if they are raw image binary
 or text encoded in Base64, it does not matter

B<Attention!> Mac OS X and iOS B<ignore> the description beeing URL

use Base64 encoding or raw image binary if you have to show the image you want

=head2 note()

To specify supplemental information or a comment that is associated with the vCard

=head2 org(), title(), role(), categories()

To specify additional information for your jobs

=head2 fn(), full_name(), fullname()

=head2 nickname()

To specify the text corresponding to the nickname of the object the vCard represents

=head2 lang()

To specify the language(s) that may be used for contacting the entity associated with the vCard.

It's the B<new method from 4.0>

=head2 impp(), xml()

I don't think they are so popular types, but here are the methods!

They are the B<new method from 4.0>

=head2 geo()

To specify information related to the global positioning of the object the vCard represents

=head2 key()

To specify a public key or authentication certificate associated with the object that the vCard represents

=head2 label()

ToDo: because B<It's DEPRECATED from 4.0>

To specify the formatted text corresponding to delivery address of the object the vCard represents

=head2 uid()

To specify a value that represents a globally unique identifier corresponding to the individual
or resource associated with the vCard

=head2 fburl(), caladruri(), caluri()

I don't think they are so popular types, but here are the methods!

They are the B<new method from 4.0>

=head2 kind()

To specify the kind of object the vCard represents

It's the B<new method from 4.0>

=head2 member(), clientpidmap()

I don't think they are so popular types, but here are the methods!

It's the B<new method from 4.0>

=head2 tz(), timezone()

Both are same method with Alias

To specify information related to the time zone of the object the vCard represents

utc-offset format is NOT RECOMMENDED in vCard 4.0

TZ can be a URL, but there is no document in L<RFC2426|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2426>
or L<RFC6350|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350>
So it just supports some text values

=head2 bday(), birthday()

Both are same method with Alias

To specify the birth date of the object the vCard represents

=head2 anniversary()

The date of marriage, or equivalent, of the object the vCard represents

It's the B<new method from 4.0>

=head2 gender()

To specify the components of the sex and gender identity of the object the vCard represents

It's the B<new method from 4.0>

=head2 prodid()

To specify the identifier for the product that created the vCard object

=head2 source()

To identify the source of directory information contained in the content type

=head2 sound()

To specify a digital sound content information that annotates some aspect of the vCard

This property is often used to specify the proper pronunciation of the name property value
 of the vCard

=head2 socialprofile()

There is no documents about X-SOCIALPROFILE in RFC but it works in iOS and Mac OS X!

I don't know well about in Android or Windows. Somebody please feedback me

=head2 label()

B<It's DEPRECATED from 4.0> You can use this method Just ONLY in vCard3.0

=head2 aroud UTF-8

If you want to send precisely the vCard with UTF-8 characters to the B<ALMOST> of smartphones, Use 3.0

It seems to be TOO EARLY to use 4.0

=head2 for under perl-5.12.5

This module uses C<\P{ascii}> in regexp so You have to use 5.12.5 and later

And this module uses Data::Validate::URI and it has bug on 5.8.x. so I can't support them
